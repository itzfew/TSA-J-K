  "content": "On that Day, friends will be enemies of one another, except for the righteous<br> جو آپس میں دوست ہیں اس روز ایک دوسرے کے دشمن ہوں گے مگر پرہیزگار کہ باہم دوست ہی رہیں گے. <br> The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbelievers Allah says, do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait الا الساعة ان تاتيهم بغتة وهم لا يشعرون only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection. الاخلاء يومئذ بعضهم لبعض عدو الا المتقين Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people انما اتخذتم من دون الله اوثنا مودة بينكم في الحياة الدنيا ثم يوم القيامة يكفر بعضكم ببعض ويلعن بعضكم بعضا وماواكم النار وما لكم من ناصرين You have taken for worship idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper. 2925 Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise عباد لا خوف عليكم اليوم ولا انتم تحزنون My servants No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve. Then He will give them the glad tidings الذين امنوا باياتنا وكانوا مسلمين You who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. AlMutamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out عباد لا خوف عليكم اليوم ولا انتم تحزنون My servants No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve. So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words الذين امنوا باياتنا وكانوا مسلمين You who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers. ادخلوا الجنة Enter Paradise means, they will be told to enter Paradise. انتم وازواجكم you and your wives means, your counterparts تحبرون in happiness Tuhbarun means, in delight and joy. يطاف عليهم بصحف من ذهب واكوب Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. وفيها ما تشتهي الانفس there will be therein all that their souls could desire. Some of them recited ما تشتهيه الانفس that their souls desire ولذ الاعين and all that eyes could delight in means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes. وانتم فيها and you will therein means, in Paradise خالدون abide forever means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah وتلك الجنة التى اورثتموها بما كنتم تعملون This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds. لكم فيها فاكهة كثيرة Therein for you will be fruits in plenty means, of all kinds. منها تاكلون of which you will eat means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best."
